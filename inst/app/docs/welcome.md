ShinySaurus is an interactive application built with the R statistical computing language that lets you dive in to a very important issue in statistics with a fun web interface!  Each of the data sets present in this application come from the [Datasaurus Dozen](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2016/08/download-datasaurus-never-trust-summary.html) collection authored by [Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com), in which traditional summary statistics such as the average, standard deviation, and correlation are __very__ similar across the data sets, even with each giving a very different picture in the form of a scatterplot!

Within the application you can explore these data sets invidually and see how the aforementioned summary statistics are impacted by selection of data points. For some fun, you can visit the animate tab to produce detailed transition data sets between the different Datasaurus sets powered by the [{metamer}](https://eliocamp.github.io/metamer/) and [{plotly}](https://plotly-r.com/) packages.
